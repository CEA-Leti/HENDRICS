<script type="text/markdown" data-help-name="ui-template">
Provides a means to render custom content or a set of node-styles depending on scope.
* HTML (including any <a href="https://vuetifyjs.com/en/components/all/" target="blank">
  Vuetify component</a>) can be rendered in the Dashboard when the scope is set to **Widget in Group**
* Custom CSS can be included in the Dashboard when the scope is set to **Page style** or **Site style**. 
  If using this for CSS, you do not need to include any &lt;style&gt; tags, as these will be automatically added.

### Details - Widget in Group
When the scope is set to **Widget in Group**, the template will be rendered in the Dashboard as HTML.
You can render dynamic content using any VueJS data-binding expressions, (e.g. `v-if`, `v-for`)
  and access incoming data to the node via the `msg` object, e.g:
```
&lt;span&gt;{{ msg?.payload }}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;div v-if="msg?.payload === 'hello'"&gt;
  I will be visible if msg.payload equals 'hello'
&lt;/div&gt;
```

#### **send(msg)**
The template comes with two built-in functions the first of which is a `send(msg)` function that
  can be used to send a `msg` from the template, e.g:
```html
&lt;v-btn @click="send({'hello': 'world'})"&gt;&lt;/v-btn&gt;
```

#### **submit()**
The second built-in function can be attached to a form. The `msg` sent will be an object
  representation of the `FormData` from the attached form, e.g:
```html
&lt;form @submit.prevent="submit"&gt;
    &lt;v-text-field name="first" label="First Name"&gt;&lt;/v-text-field&gt;
    &lt;v-text-field name="last" label="Last Name"&gt;&lt;/v-text-field&gt;
    &lt;v-btn type="submit"&gt;&lt;/v-btn&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
```
Would send the following `msg` when submitted:
```js
{ "first": <value>, "last": <value> }
```

### Details - Site Scoped Style
When the scope is set to **Site Scoped Style**, the CSS in the template will be added to the `head` of all pages.
e.g.
```css
.my-class {
  color: red;
}
```

### Details - Page Scoped Style
When the scope is set to **Site Scoped Style**, the CSS in the template will be added to the `head` of the selected page.
e.g.
```css
.my-page1-only-class {
  color: green;
}
```
